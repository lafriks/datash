# What is Datash (pronunciation: /deɪ.ˈtæʃ/) ?

Datash helps you to send or receive text or file from one device to another one through browser, it doesn't require any login or registration. It uses `end-to-end` encryption with `1024bit` public/private key and encrypts data with recipient public key before sending which ensures data is being sent to the intended person.

## How to use?

If you want to send something to someone, visit [datash.me](https://datash.me) and also let recipient open the same link, select the files or enter text you want to send and enter the `Recipient ID` shown on the top of centered control panel of recipient device, then hit `Send Securely` button to let it encrypt and send to your recipient device.
