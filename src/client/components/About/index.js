    <h2>What is Datash?</h2>
    <p>
      Datash helps you to send or receive text or file from one device to another one through browser,
      it doesn't require any login or registration.
      It uses
      <span className="highlight">end-to-end</span>
      encryption with
      <span className="highlight">1024bit</span>
      public/private key and encrypts data with recipient public key before sending which ensures
      sending to the right person.
    </p>

    <h2>How to use?</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to send something to someone, go to
      <a href="https://datash.me">datash.me</a>
      and also let recipient open the same link, select the files or enter text you want to send and
      enter the
      <span className="highlight">Recipient ID</span>
      shown on the top of centered control panel of recipient device, then hit
      <span className="highlight">Send Securely</span>
      button to let it encrypt and send to your recipient device.
    </p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      On the startup of the application, it creates
      <span className="highlight">public/private key-pair</span>
      , a
      <span className="highlight">symmetric key</span>
      and stores those on your browser. After that the server assigns a
      <span className="highlight">4 digit ID</span>
      for your current session as an identification entity.
    </p>

    <p>If we decompose the whole process into several steps it would be like below:</p>
    <div className="steps-container">
      <Steps direction="vertical" progressDot>
        {
          processSteps.map(step => (
            <Step
              key={step.title}
              title={step.title}
              description={step.description}
              status="finish"
            />
          ))
        }
      </Steps>
    </div>
  </div>
);
